# CIA-and-Attacks
CIA Triad is a basic model which means basic used in cyber security protect our information like  data,bankdetalis personal information,our files kept secret.the fullform of CIA is Confidentiality integrity availability attack attackers means How to attackers attack to our data Attack Surface means Where attackers attack like human attack surface
🛡️ CIA Triad (Security Procedure)

The CIA Triad is a security model used to design, implement, and evaluate cyber security systems.

🔐 1. Confidentiality

Confidentiality ensures that only authorized users can access information.

Procedure / Methods:
	•	User authentication (passwords, biometrics)
	•	Encryption
	•	Access control lists
	•	Role-based access

Threats & Attacks:
	•	Phishing
	•	Password attacks
	•	Spyware
	•	Data leakage

⸻

✏️ 2. Integrity

Integrity ensures that data remains accurate and unchanged during storage or transmission.

Procedure / Methods:
	•	Hashing algorithms
	•	Digital signatures
	•	Checksums
	•	Audit logs

Threats & Attacks:
	•	Data tampering
	•	Man-in-the-Middle attack
	•	SQL injection
	•	Malware modification

⸻

⚙️ 3. Availability

Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible whenever required.

Procedure / Methods:
	•	Regular backups
	•	Firewalls
	•	Load balancing
	•	Disaster recovery planning

Threats & Attacks:
	•	DoS / DDoS attacks
	•	Ransomware
	•	Hardware failure
	•	Power outages
  1. Phishing Attack

Fake emails or websites trick users into revealing sensitive data.

2. Malware Attack

Malicious software such as viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware damage systems.

3. DoS / DDoS Attack

Attackers overload servers with traffic, making services unavailable.

4. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)

Attackers secretly intercept and alter communication between two parties.

5. SQL Injection

Malicious SQL commands are injected to access or manipulate databases.

6. Brute Force Attack

Repeated attempts are made to guess passwords.

⸻

🧩 Relationship Between CIA & Attacks
	•	Confidentiality attacks → Data theft
	•	Integrity attacks → Data manipulation
	•	Availability attacks → Service disruption

Understanding this relationship helps security professionals detect threats early and design stronger defenses.

🏁 Conclusion

A strong cyber security foundation begins with understanding the CIA Triad and recognizing attack types. By applying confidentiality, integrity, and availability procedures, organizations can protect data, prevent cyber threats, and ensure system trustworthiness.
